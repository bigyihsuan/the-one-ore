# the-one-ore
A concept about refining ores, similar to Angel's Mods but simpler.

### The General Idea
There is only one ore (2 with coal? 3 with oil?) for you to mine. You have to progressively process this single ore to get the other ores in vanilla (and hopefully Bob's Mods) Factorio.

### Progression
There is a set progression, gated behind certain machines, and this items. There are 2 lines: one for vanilla, and one for Bob's:

```**Vanilla:**
1.    Burner Crusher:     Makes iron and stone. (spawn with one. Stone) //All Crushers make Crushed Stone, allowing for stone to be made. 
2.    Burner Sorter:      Makes copper (++), iron (+), slag (+)  (Needs iron)
3a.   Electric Crusher:   An upgrade of the Burner Crusher. (needs Electronic Circuits -> Iron + Copper)
3b.   Electric Sorter:    An upgrade to the Burner Sorter. (needs Electronic Circuits -> Iron + Copper)
4.    Liquifyer:          Water + ore = Crude Oil + Waste Water? (needs Electronic Circuits -> Iron + Copper)
5a.   Advanced Liquifyer: More efficient oil extraction? (Advanced Circuits)
5b.   Packager:           Pack ores together to make more plates
```

Bob's will follow a simmilar line to vanilla, TBD.
